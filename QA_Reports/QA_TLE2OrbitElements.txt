QA of OrbitElements2TLE.py

Line 32: DDMeanMotion ranges from 45:52. That means from index [44:52] which is wrong in the code.
Ans : The changes has been implemented.
QA of TLE2OrbitElements.py
Same error as above in TLE2OrbitElements.py
Ans : The changes has been implemented
In line 34 and line 37, why have we equating DMeanMotion and DDMeanMotion to those values and not taking data from TLE ???
Ans: It was done for the testing. Now the code is such that those values are taking from TLE.

QA Suggestions:
Line 22 - There should be multiplication with two too.
Line 26 - There should be multiplication with six too.
Line 37 - There should be a multiplication with 10^(-5)

Implementation:
All changes are implemented.
